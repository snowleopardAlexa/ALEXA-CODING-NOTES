1. What is CSS Transform?

Transform changes the shape and position of the affected content without disruptng the normal document flow by modifying the coordinate space. 

transform: translateX(300px) --> we move 300px object on the horizontal oxis, we move it 300px to the right. It refers to the container.

transform: translateX(100%) --> we move the same distance to the right what is the size of the object. % refers to the object, not to the container. 

transform: translate(100px, 200px); --> it moves to the right and down. We moved it on both oxis.

transform: translate(100px, 200px) scale(2) rotate(45deg); --> we move to the right and bottom, and then we doubled the size and rotate at the angle of 45 degrees. 


TRANSFORM WILL CHANGE HOW THE OBJECT APPEARS, BUT THEY WILL NOT CREATE AN ANIMATION.

THE ORDER IS IMPORTANT! THE ORDER OF TRANSFORM ACTION WILL AFFECT THE FINAL RESULT.

transform: rotate(46deg) scale(2) translate(100px, 200px); 


2. What is 3D transform?

With the CSS transform property you can use the following 3D transformation methods:

rotateX()
rotateY()
rotateZ()

The rotateX() method rotates an element around its X-axis at a given degree:

#myDiv {
  transform: rotateX(150deg);
}

The rotateY() method rotates an element around its Y-axis at a given degree:

#myDiv {
  transform: rotateY(150deg);
}

The rotateZ() method rotates an element around its Z-axis at a given degree:

#myDiv {
  transform: rotateZ(90deg);
}

3. What is perspective?

Perspective specifies on how 3D elements are viewed. 

4. What is CSS Transition?

Transition allows changes in a property to take place over time.
