2. What is client-side form validation?

form controls are filled out and in the correct format.


3. What is better: CSS validation or JS validation?

By using JavaScript, users input can be validated as they type, and we can control feedback as the user interacts with our form field. This means a more responsive, visually rich validation

Using CSS, we have access to four states of a form input with pseudo-classes. Valid, invalid, required and optional. We can use these states to provide some, albeit limited feedback for users as they fill out the form. If you are creative with your CSS, however, you can actually make them look and function pretty darn well. Using valid and invalid, we can let users know in real time if their input satisfies all the necessary requirements.

4. How to write good error messages?

- error messages should be specific to the situation:
  don't use the same error message for all validation states

- error messages should be polite
  don't blame your users that they did something wrong 
  be polite to your users
  make them feel comfortable and blame-free
